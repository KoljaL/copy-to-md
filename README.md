# Copy to Markdown

> Never spend 6 minutes doing something by hand  
> when you can spend 6 hours failing to automate it.  
> *the internet*


## Usage

In every file of your project, you can use the context menu to copy 
- the path of the file 
- the path of the file including the line number

or, if you have selected some text, you can copy

- the path of the file including the line numbers of beginning and the end of the selection
- include the selected text
to the clipboard, formatted as Markdown.

The context menu changes depending on if you have selected some text or not.
